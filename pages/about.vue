        personally experienced such things as anxiety, trauma and chronic
        fatigue syndrome, and having recovered through the same therapies I
        offer today, allows me to truly understand other's issue's, and how best
        to treat them."

      By now hopefully, you’ve pressed the play button on both my welcome and
      about me recordings and I’ve saved you valuable time on reading a page
      full of words without much connection. As a hypnotherapist, it’s important
      you get a feel for my voice and personality if we are going to do some
      work together. I’m also a strong believer in being as real on paper as I
      am in person, hopefully this all resonates and feels authentic for every
      visitor to my site.

      At this stage you would have heard my story and know, just as so many
      before me and many to follow, I’ve had my own path to travel and it’s not
      always been straight forward but it has led me to where I am today and it
      continues to get better and convince me that, miracles actually do happen,
      every single day.

      I’m that guide. My desire today and every day hereon, is to make people
      feel less broken, so they can experience more joy and happiness and less
      stress in their lives. This in turn can only benefit those around them,
      and there we have it, a beautiful ripple effect begins and reaches far and
      wide, as far as the imagination can take you!
