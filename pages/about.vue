          personally experienced such things as anxiety, trauma and chronic
          fatigue syndrome, and having recovered through the same therapies I
          offer today, allows me to truly understand other's issue's, and how
          best to treat them."

        By now hopefully, you’ve pressed the play button on both my welcome and
        about me recordings and I’ve saved you valuable time on reading a page
        full of words without much connection. As a hypnotherapist, it’s
        important you get a feel for my voice and personality if we are going to
        do some work together. I’m also a strong believer in being as real on
        paper as I am in person, hopefully this all resonates and feels
        authentic for every visitor to my site.

        At this stage you would have heard my story and know, just as so many
        before me and many to follow, I’ve had my own path to travel and it’s
        not always been straight forward but it has led me to where I am today
        and it continues to get better and convince me that, miracles actually
        do happen, every single day.
