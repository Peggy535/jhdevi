          is a therapy that focuses on the particular ways in which an
          individual thinks, behaves and acts, in the attempt to deal
          successfully with their behavioural, emotional and social problems and
          issues.

          The difference between psychotherapy and behavioural therapy is that
          psychotherapy tends to emphasise the importance of the personal
          meaning placed upon things and how the majority of thinking patterns
          begin in childhood. Behavioural therapy relates to everything the
          person does. How they act with other people, when they are alone. How
          they avoid certain aspects of life and how they engage and interact
          with the world around them. How active or inactive towards being
          involved in participating in life on a healthy level.

          The great advantage that ‘CBT’ has over other therapies is that
          clients undergoing ‘CBT’ treatment are actually learning the
          educational aspects of the therapy, which is then empowering them to
          become their own personal therapist and to be more aware of the
          circumstances, situations, behaviours and people that could cause them
          to lapse and therefore to be able to avoid these aspects in their
          lives. I bring together a combination of CBT and Curative Hypnosis to
          assist a number of my clients and we have experienced amazing results.
          Especially in stress related disorders.
