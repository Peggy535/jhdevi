          CBT is a therapy that focuses on the particular ways in which an
          individual thinks, behaves and acts, in the attempt to deal
          successfully with their behavioural, emotional and social problems and
          issues.

        The difference between psychotherapy and behavioural therapy is that
        psychotherapy tends to emphasise the importance of the personal meaning
        placed upon things and how the majority of thinking patterns begin in
        childhood. Behavioural therapy relates to everything the person does.
        How they act with other people, when they are alone. How they avoid
        certain aspects of life and how they engage and interact with the world
        around them. How active or inactive towards being involved in
        participating in life on a healthy level.
