          That instant stress relief button. Research shows that as you get
          older, if you don’t take quality time to stretch, the body will been
          to atrophy, stiffen and deteriorate. This program is like the fountain
          of youth keeping your fascia pliable and hydrated, and therefore
          restoring youthfulness to your body.

          If you suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, anxiety and stress and
          IBS Yin is accessible for you! It’s also essential for athletes,
          acting as a complimentary practice between other hard core yoga and
          training sessions. Along with Restorative, Yin is the most accessible
          of the physical yoga systems, in that it can be practised by anyone,
          regardless of age or ability. It doesn’t even require a mat, a carpet
          or blanket will do just fine. In Yin, you hold deep, floor-based
          postures in stillness for between three to five minutes. Using very
          little muscular effort, each student is encouraged to find their own
          individual ‘edge’ – the point of stress, but before pain – to the
          posture, as it is here at this precipice that we enable our bodies to
          begin to safely open.

          That calm you feel after a yin class is very real. Studies have found
          yin yoga to have a significant impact on lowering stress and anxiety
          and reducing the risk of depression. Plus, it activates your
          parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body and slows your
          heart rate. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the
          sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The
          sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. It
          triggers the fight or flight response, providing the body with a burst
          of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. Understanding
          the stress response for my clients is important for me. My clients
          first sessions are always focused on bringing forward the
          parasympathetic nervous system, that’s under hypnosis or during a Yin
          Yoga class.

          The main reason WHY I favour Yin is because it was Yin Yoga that I
          turned to during my own on going experience as a #longcovid patient.
          The fight or flight response in the body seems to play a never ending
          erratic cycle of ups and downs even when there is no real threat. Yin
          is my medicine, it plays its part in the calming down of the heart
          rate and opening up the bodies ability to heal. I personally found my
          breathing ease with the slow practice and my mind and body allowed
          myself to accept the present moment and just stop fighting against the
          unknown of the aftermath of the Covid-19 virus.
