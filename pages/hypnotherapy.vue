          Hypnotherapy is a natural therapy that can help you to cope with the
          problems and challenges of everyday life like Anxiety, phobias or
          fears, self esteem, addiction ie smoking and Weightlose to name but a
          few. Curative is a more holistic feel to the sessions and work we do
          together. The word 'hypnotherapy' is derived from ‘hypno’ - relating
          to ‘hypnosis’, and ‘therapy’ because of the therapeutic suggestions
          that are given during treatment.

          Hypnosis is an enhanced state of relaxation. You are not asleep, but
          it is something like a state just before you drift off to sleep - you
          can still hear everything, speak and even move around if you wished
          to. When you are in that state, your subconscious mind is more
          accessible and open to suggestion.

          It can be used to treat anxiety, phobias, compulsions (like over
          eating) and addictions (like smoking). It can help with pain
          management and can ease the symptoms of chronic conditions such as
          asthma and IBS. Although it cannot cure physical illnesses or
          infections, it can help boost the immune system and improve our
          ability to manage illness.
