							Hypnotherapy is a natural therapy that can help you to cope with the problems and challenges of everyday life like
							Anxiety, phobias or fears, self esteem, addiction ie smoking and Weightlose to name but a few. Curative is a more holistic
							feel to the sessions and work we do together. The word 'hypnotherapy' is derived from ‘hypno’ - relating to ‘hypnosis’,
							and ‘therapy’ because of the therapeutic suggestions that are given during treatment.
						</p>
						<p class="m-2 p-2 text-xl sm:text-2xl">
							Hypnosis is an enhanced state of relaxation. You are not asleep, but it is something like a state just before you drift
							off to sleep - you can still hear everything, speak and even move around if you wished to. When you are in that state,
							your subconscious mind is more accessible and open to suggestion.

							At the cutting edge in the field of energy psychology is EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), which utilises the meridian
							system an is therefore often known as meridian therapy or meridian psychotherapy.
						</p>
						<h3 class="text-2xl m-2 p-2">The Meridian System</h3>
						<p class="m-2 p-2 text-xl sm:text-2xl">
							A basic theory of energy work is that the energy field, or aura body, contains energy structures and channels through
							which the life force flows. The most well known of these are the chakras and the meridians. The chakras are often referred
							to in metaphysical and spiritual work and are thought to act something like transformers, taking energy in one form and
							converting it into another. The meridians are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine,(TCM) acupuncture, acupressure, chi
							kung and reiki and are considered to be primary channels for the life force energy, much like an 'energy bloodstream'.
						</p>
						<h3 class="text-2xl m-2 p-2">How does it work?</h3>
						<p class="m-2 p-2 text-xl sm:text-2xl">
							EFT tapping uses the same energy meridians in the body as acupuncture. When the flow of energy becomes blocked because of
							pain, trauma or an experience, fears can start to grow. EFT helps to alter that flow of energy. We can work to process
							those emotions through tapping on various parts of the face and body. matching that with positive statements, we can
							transform our negative beliefs into positive ones. Using tapping in your daily routine can help with daily stresses and
							anxieties. It can also ease chronic pain, treat addictions, eliminate phobias and help elevate allergies, the list is
							endless.

							CBT is a therapy that focuses on the particular ways in which an individual thinks, behaves and acts, in the attempt to
							deal successfully with their behavioural, emotional and social problems and issues.
						</p>
						<p class="m-2 p-2 text-xl sm:text-2xl">
							The difference between psychotherapy and behavioural therapy is that psychotherapy tends to emphasise the importance of
							the personal meaning placed upon things and how the majority of thinking patterns begin in childhood. Behavioural therapy
							relates to everything the person does. How they act with other people, when they are alone. How they avoid certain aspects
							of life and how they engage and interact with the world around them. How active or inactive towards being involved in
							participating in life on a healthy level.
						</p>

						<p class="m-2 p-2 text-xl sm:text-2xl">
							The great advantage that ‘CBT’ has over other therapies is that clients undergoing ‘CBT’ treatment are actually learning
							the educational aspects of the therapy, which is then empowering them to become their own personal therapist and to be
							more aware of the circumstances, situations, behaviours and people that could cause them to lapse and therefore to be able
							to avoid these aspects in their lives. I bring together a combination of CBT and Curative Hypnosis to assist a number of
							my clients and we have experienced amazing results. Especially in stress related disorders..
